/**
 * A representation of the existing Flight records, which your program will need
 * to work with.
 * 
 * This class provides a functional interface which allows for the Booking
 * Management System developer to interact with a simulated record in the
 * following ways:
 * 
 * retrieve the Flight destination and Flight numbers required to instantiate
 * the FlightBooking and HodidayBooking Objects
 * 
 * retrieve Flight costs
 *
 * 
 * Note that you are not permitted to change or add to the code below, rather
 * you need to determine how to create an instance of this record and invoke the
 * methods it provides as needed when implementing your Booking Management
 * System functionality.
